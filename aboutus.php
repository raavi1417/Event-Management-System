<h1>About Us</h1>
<hr>
<div class="text">
   Improvised Event Management System (IEMS) is an online portal developed for an organization to manage its events digitally. Having such a platform will ease out the activities carried out by event conductors such as attendees, organizers and event reviewers.
<br>
In this application, a user can be an administrator or event attendee. The administrator will have various privileges viz. editing event's information, creating and adding a new event, deleting an event when required and a user can register for various events and collect certificates for the same.
<br>
The aim of this project is to overcome the limitations of existing platforms meanwhile adding some useful functionalities like digital certificate generation and collection.
